I want to create an app named hours , and which people can measure their spent hours in different tasks, and they can also said that I have to spend two hours in dsa daily, when it will remain them off spent.And while doing dsa and turn on the timer, if they are doing any other work that is for that, they can add that work. And turn on the timer after the work.They can pause it, also like google tasks, they can set repeetitive task task for daily.And for any day, they can turn off the task, and if the timer is off, the time will be counted is unclassified hours , that in the end of the day, the user came classic, where they have spent that time. This is the way users can track their whole journey.Whole day, whole month and become more productive, because sometimes we promise ourselves like we're study this much from 2026 are we'll study this much from tomorrow onwards. But we exactly don't know, and there are so many problems that if you're not measuring, we're just guessing. So along with these thoughts, create the whole app prd

Create the thoughts and description like after reading it, people will be like.I want this app.I need this app.This happens.Everything something like this.And they can relate, and they will feel very more motivated to download them.And whatever you can think of think longer and create a full document about this.That why you need this app

People can bet get the best analytics data that can say to other People optionally. 
And also get yearly recap

People can do both timers or more than one work at the time.But this will be not recommended and say that the app doesn't track your battery and your app uses data.Optionally you can share that to get the best analytics.

Also increase integrate promodoro timer and other productivity hacks techniques
